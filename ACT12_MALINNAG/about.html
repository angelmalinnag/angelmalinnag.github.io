                </center>
                <p>Data Center College of the Philippines (DCCP) was founded in 1974 by Engr. Wilfredo M. Bactad with a vision to bridge the gap between academic learning and industry requirements, particularly in the rapidly growing field of technology.
                    The institution started as a small center for technology education in the heart of Baguio City and has grown over nearly five decades into a respected name in Philippine education with multiple branches, including those in Laoag City
                    and Bangued, Abra. A major milestone came in 2005 with the expansion of its programs and facilities to accommodate a growing student population and a wider range of course offerings, which now include information technology, business
                    administration, and hospitality management. In 2015, the college further solidified its commitment to innovation by launching a technology innovation center for advanced research and development and strengthening industry partnerships.
                    Today, DCCP continues to lead the way in digital education, preparing students for the demands of the global job market and the age of Industry 4.0.</p>
